**NOTE**: This buildpack is in an experimental OSS project.

# heroku-buildpack-static

## WARNING: `heroku-buildpack-static` is deprecated

This buildpack is deprecated and is no longer being maintained.
If you are using this project, you can transition over to NGINX via an NGINX buildpack.
Use your project's existing configuration.
To find the NGINX configuration generated by the heroku-buildpack-static you can run:

```
$ heroku run bash
~ $ bin/config/make-config
~ $ cat config/nginx.conf
```

These commands will output your current NGINX config generated from your `static.json` contents. Write
these contents to your local repo, commit them to disk and configure an NGINX buildpack to
serve your application with that configuration.
